    <p>My name is Isaac Moore, and I'm studying software engineering here at BYUI. I enjoy surfing, gaming, and spending time with my little siblings. When I'm not at school I live in Carlsbad, California where I get the opportunity to enjoy warm weather and the beaches. I'm primarily taking this class because it's required for my degree, but I also think it could be interesting and/or useful to know these things.</p>
