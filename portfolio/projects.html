            <p class="project-description">This project is a Grocery List Creator and manager application. 
                This is an app designed to help you plan out your grocery list in an easy and 
                effective way. It utilizes a database of thousands of products from your nearest 
                Target in order to be able to find what you need. It has an easy to use search 
                feature, user friendly interface, and even a slider to increase the font size 
                in case you can't quite read the text on your device.

            <p class="project-description">This next project is a sudoku solving program. Run this in your 
                operating system's terminal and plug in each number in that sudoku puzzle you 
                can't solve. After all the data is in there you just need to hit enter and it 
                will almost instantly return a completed copy of what you just put in. It utilizes 
                a recursive function that will call itself in order to work at the puzzle one 
                empty box at a time.

            <h1 class="project-name">Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
            <p class="project-description">This project is a simply rock paper scissors game. This project 
                showcases a neat user interface done in html and css, as well as the java-script 
                that creates the logic for the game to work. The interface is responsive to your 
                actions; chaning color as you hover and click on each of the buttons. Additionally 
                a short description will update every time you click a button to reflect how the 
                previous match went.
